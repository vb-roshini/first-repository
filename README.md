# Intro
Hey! I am VB Roshini, AM25B040.
I am currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computatiinal Engineering and Mechanics in IIT Madras.
I come from Andhra Pradesh.
I am very much interested in Python Programming.
My hobbies include listening to music and watching movies 
# What I like about Git
Git makes version control easier
It helps me have a history where we can view all the changes made to a file instead of creating new files again and again
# Python Assignment I've enjoyed the most 
My favourite python assignment was masking up an email.
Though it took a long time for me to complete (Because I am a beginner), I enjoyed and it helped me learn about a few built-in functions in python as well.
